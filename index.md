# Electric Chameleon
The Chameleon is a reptilian creature who has an innate ability to change its skin color with its surroundings. Using a variety of color sensors and leds, my project is able to sense as well as portray its surrounding colors with beautiful ambient light.

# Final Milestone
  

My final milestone was getting the led to light up based upon the readings from the color sensor. When I tried to use the internet I found a variety of unpractical solutions, but since at the time it was all I had, I watched a two hour video on how to correlate the two. The video suggested I use each indivisual color reading from the sensor and write a command that should that color appear it should light the led to the following red, green, and blue values. When my instructor saw me struggling he gave me a suprisingly easy alternative, simply using a pixel.fill function and using the red, green, and blue values I defined as well as the other two values which represented the start and end of the led. Ultimately, the final code was quite simple.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is the reading of my color sensor. While I ran into multiple code errors, I evantually got the correct library, which I later learned needed a seperate libarary and for me to organize the code. In the process I learned about the include function, how to use arduino libraries, and the serial print function. I then organized the following which led to me getting the correct red green and blue values.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is my led lighting up. This was difficult becasue I ran into a couple of tehcnical issues with code, but more significantly with architecture. MY led was not given jumper cables, so I had to solder them on. In doing so I was required to learn how to solder and finally suceeded after multiple failures. I learend that in order to verify if you soldered correctly you would use the multimeter and touch each ends of the wire to see if they were giving the same reading. For three attempts, one port of the three didn't. Leading me to try a different led ring, which later worked.
